This is a speculative analysis based on fig 1c from https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wefo/35/6/WAF-D-19-0253.1.xml
and using only single point of data (Assuming the NHC official forecast for Idalia falls into the same distribution of biases)
For the advisory 24 hours out: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCMAT5+shtml/291453.shtml
It has the current max wind speed at 75 kt. Forecast is for 110 kt, 24 hours later.
The change in max intensity is 35kt, putting it into the 4th column to the right of the y axis for fig 4c.
Note the bins appear to be separated by 10kt (0-10kt, 10-20kt, etc) for fig 4c. So, the number of events for each intensity range is roughly:

0 to 10 kt: 3
-10 to 0 kt: 55
-20 to -10 kt: 148
-30 to -20 kt: 89
-40 to -30 kt: 15

310 events total.

I then interpolate the number of events to fit the hurricane intensity category scale:
  For instance, for the -10 to 0 kt error range, what is relevant is that 110kt + 2.5 kt is the cutoff for cat 3 or cat 4:
    So to the number of events for this error range I add (2.5/10)*55 events to the total to keep it still a cat 3, and (7.5/10)*55 to the total number of events for make it a cat 4.

Analysis:

Category 1 (64-82 kt):
The forecast intensity is 110 kt, which is well above the error ranges that could lower it to Category 1. The probability is 0.

Category 2 (83-95 kt):
There are also no events that fall into this category based on the given data. The probability is 0.

Category 3 (96-112 kt):
The forecast intensity is 110 kt, which falls within the error ranges to keep it a category 3.
The events that fall into the error range of 0 to 10 kt and -10 to 0 kt could potentially keep the intensity within Category 3:

0 to 10 kt: 3 events
-10 to 0 kt: (2.5/10) * 55 ≈ 13.75 events (interpolating)
The total number of events in the range that maintains Category 3 is 3 + 13.75 = 16.75.
The total number of events considered for all error ranges is 55 + 3 + 148 + 89 + 15 = 310.
Therefore, the probability is 16.75 / 310 ≈ 0.0540.

Category 4 (113-136 kt):
The forecast intensity is 110 kt, which is below the lower limit of this category.

The events that fall into the error ranges of -20 to -30 kt, -10 to -20 kt, and -10 to 0 kt could potentially bring the intensity within Category 4:

-20 to -30 kt: (6.5/10) * 89 ≈ 57.85 events (interpolating)
-10 to -20 kt: 148 events (all)
-10 to 0 kt: (7.5/10) * 55 ≈ 41.25 events (interpolating)
The total number of events in the range that upgrades to Category 4 is 57.85 + 148 + 41.25 = 247.10.
The total number of events considered for all error ranges is 310.
Therefore, the probability is 247.10 / 310 ≈ 0.7968.

Category 5 (137 kt or higher):
The forecast intensity is 110 kt, which is below the lower limit of this category. The events that fall into the error range of -30 to -20 kt could potentially bring the intensity within Category 5:

-30 to -20 kt: (3.5/10) * 89 ≈ 31.15 events (interpolating)
The events that fall into the error range of -40 to -30 kt:
-40 to -30 kt: 15 events (all)
The total number of events in the range that upgrades to Category 5 is 31.15 + 15 = 46.15.
The total number of events considered for all error ranges is 310.
Therefore, the probability is 46.15 / 310 ≈ 0.1489.

In summary, the probabilities for each hurricane category range are as follows:

Category 1: 0 %
Category 2: 0 %
Category 3: 5 %
Category 4: 80 %
Category 5: 15 %
